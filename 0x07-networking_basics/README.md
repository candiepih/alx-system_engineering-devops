# Networking basics #0

This topic was aimed at understanding various networking concepts such as:_

* what is the OSI model layers it has and how it's organized
* what the LAN is it's typical usage and it's typical geographical size
* what the WAN is it's typical usage and it's typical geographical size
* What is the Internet
* What is an IP address
* What are the 2 types of IP address
* What is localhost
* What is a subnet
* Why IPv6 was created

* TCP/UDP
* What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
* difference between TCP and UDP
* What is a port
* Memorizing SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
* What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

Below task files helped testing my understanding on the various concepts
