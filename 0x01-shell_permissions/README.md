# Shell permissions 
This topics aim was to understand:-
* What the commands chmod, sudo, su, chown, chgrp do
* Linux file permissions
* How to represent each of the three sets of permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single digit
* How to change permissions, owner and group of a file
* Why can’t a normal user chown a file
* How to run a command with root privileges
* How to change user ID or become superuser
